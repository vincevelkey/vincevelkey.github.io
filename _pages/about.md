Hi, and welcome to my homepage. 

I am a PhD Candidate in Machine Learning at the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/) at University College London, advised by Prof. [Peter Orbanz](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~porbanz/).

My research focuses on mathematical aspects of probabilistic machine learning and Bayesian statistics. Currently, I am working on de Finetti-style representation theorems for symmetric random structures, with an emphasis on finite exchangeability, and symmetries beyond exchangeability.

More broadly, I am interested in Bayesian nonparametric methods and statistical aspects of random network models. I also have some interests in optimal transport and causal inference.

Previously, I completed a BA and MMath in mathematics at Cambridge, specialising in pure mathematics, particularly functional analysis. I also took the interdisciplinary [Logic Year](https://msclogic.illc.uva.nl/programme/logic-year/) programme at the [ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl/), University of Amsterdam, focusing on machine learning.

Current Research
======
*Exchangeability, graph limits and exponential families*

 I use tools from functional analysis and information theory to study problems in exchangeability theory. My work makes explicit the analogy between de Finetti-style representation theorems for a broad class of symmetric random structures. That includes
 infinite exchangeable and partially exchangeable sequences, infinite exchangeable graphs and their finite exchangeable counterparts. Preprint in preparation.
